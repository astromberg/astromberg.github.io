         <h1>NBA In Game Win Probability</h1>
         <p>Bear with me for a second. I&rsquo;ve get pretty stressed out when watching the Denver Broncos play. Part of my routine involves finding the in game win probability chart so that I know when I should just walk away from the game (good or bad). I also always have trouble finding these charts online, a couple of these sites like Advanced NFL Stats have slowly stopped or broken down over the years. So I figure I should make one myself!</p>

<p>This is right around the time that the Warriors were on their run for a second title with Steph Curry, so I thought I would start with basketball first. It seems a lot more straightforward because there are a lot more scoring events and the data was much much easier to get my hands on, thanks to Michael Beuoy for pointing me in the right spot.</p>

<p>My first approach is to look back at previous situations and find out how likely you were to win in that situation. The &ldquo;situation&rdquo; was defined by what the difference in score was and the time remaining (aligned to 10 second bins). This produced results which seemed pretty good. Someday I&rsquo;ll ressurect them and see if I can make some charts.</p>

<p>The second approach was to use a Logit GLM to fit a variety of data. I included home vs away, score differential, whether or not you currently possess the ball, and percentage of the game which had been completed. After my wife showed me that I should use the logit and how to convert that set of constants into a formula that produces a probability, we got this:</p>

<p>$$y = e^{-(0.2775 - 0.4483 \cdot A + 0.3208 \cdot T \cdot S + 0.2894 \cdot P)}$$
$$Probability = 1 / (1 + y)$$</p>

<p>A = 1 if you are the away team, 0 if you are the home team.<br />
T = Percentage of time remaining, from 0 to 1.<br />
S = Score differential, your team&rsquo;s score - the other team.<br />
P = 1 if you possess the ball, 0 if you don&rsquo;t possess the ball.</p>

<p>I also tried some variations where ignore possession and produced some nice 3D plots.</p>

<p><img src="/img/igwip.gif" alt="Example image" /></p>

<p>In future iterations I hope to wire up a website that will produce these charts on demand, for past games or games which are currently being played. Some improvements I&rsquo;d like to make eventually are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Overtime - Right now I don&rsquo;t include any overtime states in the model.</li>
<li>End Game - The model doesn&rsquo;t take into account that if you have possession, are leading, and there is &lt; $SHOT_CLOCK_TIME remaining, then you&rsquo;ve basically won. The model underestimates your chances of winning in these scenarios.</li>
<li>On demand charts for past games and currently active games.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to eventually take a crack at doing this for the NFL.</p>
